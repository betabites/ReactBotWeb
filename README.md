# (UNOFFICAL) ReactBot Web
This extension adds ReactBot (by Jacksflims, Camtoonist, and Cuyoya) to your YouTube! Now you can browse YouTube and have ReactBot react to the content!

# Installing:
## Firefox
ReactBot Web is available for FireFox from the offical Mozilla Add-ons website:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/unoffical-reactbot-web/edit

## Chrome & Opera
The verification process form the Chrome Web Store takes a significant amount of time. This means that the version on the Chrome Web Store may be somewhat behind other versions.
[Waiting for the first version to be verified]

## Microsoft Edge
[Waiting for the extension to be verified]

## Safari
We're working on a Safari-compatible version of this, but we cannot make any guarantees about it. Mostly due to platform-based difficulties.

## Manual Install (Chrome/Edge/Opera)
If you want to install the latest version of ReactBot Web without waiting for your relevant extension store to accept it, you can follow these steps:
1. Go to the 'Releases' page; https://github.com/betabites/ReactBotWeb/releases
2. Under the most recent release, download `Assets > extension.zip`.
3. Once downloaded, move the ZIP to a safe location on your device and extract it.
   - The process for extracting a zip may vary depending on your device. If you're unsure, look it up.
5. In the browser of your choice, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
6. Once you're on the 'extensions' page you should see a toggle labeled 'Developer mode'. Toggle this on.
7. There should now be a button labeled 'load unpacked'. Click this button.
8. In the dialog window, navigate to and select the folder you extracted `extension.zip` to. You'll know the folder you've selected is correct if it has a sub-folder labeled `GrabBag`.
   - If you are asked to select a file instead of a folder, double-click the `manifest.json`
10. All done! The ReactBot Web extension is now loaded!
